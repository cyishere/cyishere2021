          I am a self-taught <em>front-end developer</em> who also makes{" "}
          <em>full-stack</em> stuff.

          The first time I encountered “web development” was about 15 years ago
          when I changed my blogpost blog’s background color with CSS, that’s
          amazed me a lot!{" "}
          <strong>I thought it’s very cool, the internet is the future!</strong>{" "}
          Around that time, I just graduated from college, and despite I studied
          finance I decided to change my career to web development. So I started
          to learn programming by myself, reading books, articles, and
          discussions online.

          I got my first development job in 2007. From 2007 to 2012, I was a
          frontend developer and UX designer, most of my work was writing CSS
          hacks for IE6, and playing around with jQuery. Made a lot of templates
          for WordPress and e-commerce websites.

          Later I switched my career path and started a production company with
          my friends. I was a screenplay writer in the last four years (
          <strong>also self-taught</strong>). But I still love web development a
          lot. Developers work on code and take films as entertainment, I worked
          on films and take programming as entertainment. When I didn’t study
          films, I read articles about web development and follow along with the
          tutorials on{" "}

          I spend last year catching up on the new tech stacks. Now, I&apos;m a
          fan of React, GraphQL and Prisma.
